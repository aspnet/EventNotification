EventNotification [Archived]
============================

**This GitHub project has been archived.** Ongoing development on this project can be found in <https://github.com/aspnet/Extensions>.

Notice
-------

The infrastructure for publishing notifications has moved to the .NET Framework. See the new [`DiagnosticSource`](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/blob/master/src/System.Diagnostics.DiagnosticSource/src/System/Diagnostics/DiagnosticSource.cs) and [`DiagnosticListener`](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/blob/master/src/System.Diagnostics.DiagnosticSource/src/System/Diagnostics/DiagnosticListener.cs) APIs in the `System.Diagnostics.DiagnosticSource` package. The infrastructure provided here is for subscribing to events using runtime-generated proxies.

This project is part of .NET Extensions. You can find samples, documentation and getting started instructions at the [Extensions](https://github.com/aspnet/Extensions) repo.
